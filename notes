Rhythm-style game

Mixing decks
	One loop on each deck, progress timer to interact at the right time to break out of one loop, into the next
	Each type of loop has a tolerance property, drums have the largest value, high-pitch or annoying loops have low tolerance values - audience will start to tire of loops after time * tolerance
	Audience will leave if you don't keep pleasing them
	Upgrade your samples, gear (music, lights, stage, etc.), fans?, venue?
	Records get scratched over time
	Add special effects - interact opportunities to scratch, slowdown, change setting on fx processor, etc.
